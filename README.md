<h1>Base configuration for an Altera DE10 Lite board using VHDL.</h1>

<h2>What this project does</h2>
It defines all the pins for a DE10 Lite board so that one can program it without having to use the "Pin Planner".<br>
Two folders are included:<br>
<b>de10_lite_base:</b><br>
&emsp;This includes only the bare minimum pins.<br>
<b>de10_lite_counter:</b><br>
&emsp;This is a full project that counts in hexadecimal on the seven segment displays, and resets on button press.<br>

<h2>How to use:</h2>
Just open either project in Quartus Prime and compile and upload.<br><br><br>
